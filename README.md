Infra-strucutre automation (people call it as configuration managment/ Distributed systems managment) is something i really liked, it's very simple and time saving but very dangerous too (serious issues might occur if you don't know what you are doing). so, my first date with Infra-strucutre automation tools happened while i was preparing my-self to get into Dev-Ops world, and it happened with Chef. Chef Server , Chef client, Cookbooks, time of convergence, all these nomenclature was so attractive, that i instantly fell in love with Chef. 


But,as the time goes on you will start realizing do i actually love this, or is it just something am attracted too. The great confusion that no on will wish to fall into. But, unfortunatly i fell into it. when i got introduced to Ansible. But, lets not get into this now, let's try to focus why we are here. But, am certainly sure out there,there are many people like me who want to learn something new, something that has got demand in market.Common questions that come into our mind, How do i start? what will i get out of this? yes ! i am there, i can feel that. 


How do i start? 
My philosophy of learning something new is, first understand why was it introduced, how were things handled beofre that, rather than just blindly jumping into the concept. then you will get an idea of what you are dealing with. Then, next is to make a list of key players in the game (if you have come this far then am sure you have enough googling skills to make a list).Then here comes the next and crucial step, most people tend to learn the tool that they currently need, which is good. But if you have time and if you are learning this out of intresent or in preparation for you next job, we i would go for the one which is toughest, bec. when you are feeling good working on the toughest architecture and the easiest will be a cake walk.
